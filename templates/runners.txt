# most competitive programming problems are limited to a 2 second run time sometimes it may go higher
# I prefer to have a program stop executing at 5 seconds normally, change it if you want to or have to
# timeout and time won't work for you if you anyway are using powershell. remove them if you do.
# The powershell equivalent of the bash "time" command is "measure-command"
# If you get file doesn't exist errors, try adding ./ before filenames
